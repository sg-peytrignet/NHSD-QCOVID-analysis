# Impact of QCOVID algorithm on number of people asked to shield in England

#### Project Status: In progess

## Project Description

- This is part of the Networked Data Lab's analysis  on clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) people, also known as the shielding population - the group of people most at risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 . This group were asked to not leave their homes and to minimise all face-to-face contact up until the end of July 2020 in most of the UK. Whilst the shielding guidance was paused over Summer, people were once again asked to minimise their contact with others from November.

- We summarise the number of people asked to shield both before and after the QCOVID algorithm was launched, and stratify according to levels of deprivation.

## Data sources

This analysis relies on the following data sources.

- The [Shielded Patient List (SPL)](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/mi-english-coronavirus-covid-19-shielded-patient-list-summary-totals) total published by NHS Digital.
- 2019 [English](https://data-communities.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d4b79be994ac4820ad44e10ded313df3_0) Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles.
- 2019 mid-year [population estimates](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates).
